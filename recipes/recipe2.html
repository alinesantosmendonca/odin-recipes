<p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

<ul>
    <li>2.5kg floury potatoes such as maris piper, estima or king edward</li>
    <li>5 tbsp olive oil</li>
</ul>

<p><h2>Method</h2></p>

Cut the potatoes into large, roughly even-size chunks (see tip). Put each potato chunk flat-side down on a chopping board and, using a sharp knife, make a series of cuts into it, along its whole length, to about two thirds of the depth of the potato. Make the incisions as close together as you can äóñ about 2mm apart. <br>
Put the potatoes in a bowl of well salted water and leave to stand for 30 minutes, then drain.<br>
Preheat the oven to 200C/fan180C/gas 6. Briefly pat the potatoes dry with kitchen paper. Heat the olive oil in a large roasting tin, then tumble the potatoes into it, turning to coat in the olive oil but making sure all the cut sides are uppermost in the pan. Roast for 1 hour 10-20 minutes, basting every so often, until the potatoes are golden and crisp, and tender all the way through. Sprinkle with sea salt and serve.


<p><h2>Tips!</h2></p>
<ul>
    <li>Peel and cut the potatoes the day before and leave them soaking in salted water overnight somewhere very cool or in the fridge.</li>
    <li>Cooking the potatoes in olive oil works brilliantly here, but if you’re not having vegetarian guests, use 50g goose fat instead. It makes exceptionally crispy and tasty roast potatoes.</li>
</ul>
